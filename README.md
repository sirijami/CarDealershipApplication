# NeuJan17-project

Steps to get the code to your IDE(eclipse)

1. Download/clone the code from git repository.
2. Create a new folder in your desktop(let's say javaProject-workspace) and add the downloaded gitcode folder in it.
3. For Eclipse, Create a new workspace with the directory being (Users/yourAwesomeName/...../javaProject-workspace)
   and click ok 
4. Now, we have to make eclipse detect the source code. Since the folder is already present in the workspace,
  you can start by creating a new Java project, and when you give it the name of the folder, eclipse
  will auto detect and add in defaults.
  In eclipse File-->New-->JavaProject-->NeuJan17-project(which is the downloded code from git).
5. If you have already have git plugins for eclipse, eclipse will show the branch name and other details too. 

That's it...Start coding

Tip:
Make sure you have the latest jdk (java 8)
